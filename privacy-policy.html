  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 16, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>LexiGrid</strong> (the “App”) is a mobile game developed by <strong>XoRdbX</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains what data we process, why, and how you can exercise your rights—especially regarding consent under the GDPR and Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP).</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <div class="block small">
    <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show ads and <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to understand how the game is used. In the European Economic Area (EEA/UK), we ask for your consent via <strong>Google UMP</strong> before collecting analytics or showing personalized ads. If you refuse consent, analytics are disabled and only non-personalized ads are shown.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect names, emails, or other directly identifying data. Through our partners, the following categories may be processed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics (Firebase Analytics)</strong>: app instance identifiers, session data (session start/length), device info (model, OS version, language), country/region, in-game events (e.g., level start/complete, boosters used), crash/quality signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising (Google AdMob)</strong>: Advertising ID, ad impressions and clicks, basic device information; if consent is granted, ads may be personalized using Google’s signals.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small">We configure the App so that analytics collection can be fully disabled until consent is given (via <code>FirebaseAnalytics.SetAnalyticsCollectionEnabled(false)</code>), and AdMob respects your UMP choices (personalized vs. non-personalized ads).</p>

  <h2>3. Purposes of Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and improve the game</strong> (measure features, balance gameplay, fix bugs and performance issues).</li>
    <li><strong>Show ads</strong> to fund the App (personalized only with consent; otherwise non-personalized).</li>
    <li><strong>Security and abuse prevention</strong> (aggregate signals to protect services).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Bases (GDPR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): analytics measurement and personalized advertising in the EEA/UK are based on your explicit consent collected via UMP.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): essential operations such as delivering non-personalized ads and ensuring the App’s security and basic functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Consent & Privacy Options (UMP)</h2>
  <p>On first launch (and periodically as required), users in the EEA/UK see a UMP consent form to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow or refuse analytics measurement (Firebase Analytics).</li>
    <li>Choose between personalized or non-personalized ads (AdMob).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can change your choice at any time from the App’s <strong>“Privacy / Ad Options”</strong> screen (which reopens the UMP privacy options form). If you withdraw consent, analytics collection is disabled going forward and ads become non-personalized.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing & Processors</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your data. We share data with our service providers solely to operate the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> — <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy</a> · <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase & privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy</a> · <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EEA/UK consent</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Google acts as our data processor for these services under Google’s data processing terms.</p>

  <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed outside your country (e.g., in the United States). Google implements safeguards such as the <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> to comply with GDPR requirements for international transfers.</p>

  <h2>8. Retention</h2>
  <p>Analytics data is retained according to Firebase settings (typically 14–26 months) and then deleted or aggregated. Ad-related logs are retained according to Google’s policies.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>Subject to legal limits, you have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and receive a copy of your personal data</li>
    <li>Request rectification or erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to processing (including analytics)</li>
    <li>Data portability</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent at any time (without affecting prior lawful processing)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Within the App, you can withdraw consent via the <strong>Privacy / Ad Options</strong> screen. You may also request deletion/reset of analytics identifiers; we can trigger <code>ResetAnalyticsData()</code> in response to your request.</p>

  <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>LexiGrid is designed for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children.</p>

  <p>The App does not intentionally collect or process personal information from minors. If you believe that a minor has provided personal data through the App without appropriate consent, please contact us so that we can promptly delete such information.</p>

  <p>Use of the App by minors should always take place under the supervision and consent of a parent or legal guardian. The developer of LexiGrid cannot be held responsible for any use of the App by minors without such supervision or consent.</p>

  <p>Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor the digital activities of those under their care and to help ensure a safe and appropriate experience.</p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We apply technical and organizational measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>12. Your Choices & Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In-app privacy options</strong>: open the App’s <em>Privacy / Ad Options</em> to change consent at any time (UMP).</li>
    <li><strong>Device settings</strong>: you can reset your Advertising ID and limit ad personalization in your OS settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics</strong>: refuse analytics in the UMP form; we will disable Firebase Analytics collection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>13. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or want to exercise your rights, contact:</p>
  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:xordbx76@gmail.com">xordbx76@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>14. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above and, where appropriate, notify you in the App.</p>
